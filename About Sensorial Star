Imagine a life without your senses. What if you can't see your loved ones or are not be able to feel their touch? What if you can't smell your favourite flower or taste delicious food? Imagine a life without sound… It is quite difficult, because most of us are born with these abilities. 

Sensorial Star is inspired by human beings and by the incredible functionality of our bodies. Humans have evolved with and belong to the natural environment which has developed our senses and guides us in decisions of survival and well-being.

Sensorial Star helps ambitious people to gain incredible confidence by providing therapeutic and educational programs. These programs are built around concepts involving the five senses and the mind.

This new business is a sole proprietorship, owned and operated by Marju Kivi. Marju began building this business four years ago when she realised how scent can influence human emotions through natural botanical perfumery. So she began researching about aromacology and pure natural aromatic extracts.
More than a decade-long experience as a distiller provided a great basis for this process.

As all five senses connect us to our mind where processing of collected information is taking place, it is vital that one can confidently filter thoughts, emotions and habits. Sensorial Star is currently developing programs to assist everyone who is open to this process to improve their persona.

Sensorial Star envisions a future where anyone can renew their quality of life though guided individual discovery of their personality and thereby increase their confidence.
The company will provide online and in-person services.
